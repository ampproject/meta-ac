# **Minutes**

*   Design review roster
    *   If we found it valuable to meet the Outreach WG during our last call, there might be value in joining design reviews. Those combine quarterly updates by working groups with reviews of new features.
    *   Reviews happen every other week on a rolling basis for time zones. TSC joins them every 6 weeks. ([Design reviews schedule](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/labels/Type%3A%20Design%20Review).)
    *   Our role would be as observers, but representing the AC when there’s known AC consensus. We could bring back topics and invite WG for follow-ups if necessary.
    *   Ideally we’d just go to design reviews that have topics we’re interested in, but the agendas are published sufficiently in advance for that. Hard to assess value without actually giving it a try.
    *   Consensus that we should go ahead and join a few meetings and reassess.
    *   AI is for Jory and Tobie to plan the roster and share with all of you.
*   TSC meeting roster
    *   We will do the same AI as above for the TSC roster. 
*   Work on focus areas
    *   We decide to focus on URLs and move our work to the [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1gDMTMn_ywDkCZzHTMSdrhtrI0UTb_OrnSJ984ZdCNzI/viewer?ts=5e29bc85&f=0).
*   AI: Share the result of the board with Kenji to get his feedback and answers.
*   AI: Roster planning
