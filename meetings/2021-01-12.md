        *   13 Jan 2021 @ 20:00 UTC
    *   Check roster for Design reviews.
*   Opening remarks
*   [@edent](https://github.com/edent) resignation ([#170](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/pull/170))
    *   Find new champion(s) for [Standards focus](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/162).
        *   Jett also interested to champion this.
*   Follow-through on last year's focus on accessibility (see [#62](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/62)).
*   Reviewed the different focus areas and had members sign-up for the ones they were interested in.
*   Discussion: bringing AMP improvements to standards and asking to sunset AMP caches (see [comment](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/171#issuecomment-757005803)).
    *   Question to publishers: what are the issues that you are having with AMP documents being served by AMP caches? Which of these issues are still not resolved by Signed Exchanges and why?
    *   In Pakistan: low bandwidth issues even for 4G + data issues (5mb daily free tier) => people consuming stale news.
        *   Using AMP to enable &lt; 5mb (free tier) with PWA/AMP hybrid
        *   Outcomes: 
            *   20 million new subscribers
            *   Fresh news
            *   Civic engagement
    *   Privacy preserving pre-rendering (PPP)
        *   Important to make distinction between pre-rendering and pre-fetching
        *   PPP is only useful for true cross-origin navigation
        *   Protect the IP address of the user
        *   Other solutions to PPP:  [https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/continuing-our-journey-to-bring-instant.html](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/continuing-our-journey-to-bring-instant.html)
            *   Can we have multiple proxies? Would this require an audit
        *   Can Web Packaging help with PPP?
            *   Doesnâ€™t enable pre-rendering by itself
            *   Other solutions in the work. Needs more discussion.
*   Update about next meeting (CAT presentation by [@darobin](https://github.com/darobin) and [@justinph](https://github.com/justinph), see [#172](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/172) for details).
    *   Todo: Tobie to share video as soon as it is available.
