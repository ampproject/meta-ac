# **Minutes**

*   Approve last call's minutes - 
    *   [https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/pull/108](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/pull/108)
*   Acknowledge resignation of [@levidurfee](https://github.com/levidurfee)
    *   Consider whether we want to run elections early - discuss further at a later date
*   Report from recent TSC & Design Review meetings - 
    *   Nothing to report
*   Check rosters for upcoming TSC & Design Review meetings
    *   Sign-ups taken
*   Discussion of recent announcement about the page experience metrics and impact on AMP
    *   See [https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html)
    *   Top stories will no longer require AMP
    *   Vitals metrics changing  - Most of AMP meets these metrics requirements
    *   Timing - tools are available now; ranking & top stories updates will wait until 2021. Will provide a 6 months heads up before this change occurs.
    *   Google plans to continue investing in AMP.
    *   AMP Pre-rendering strategy unchanged.
    *   Eligibility to top-story carousel will open-up to non-AMP content.
    *   AMP results are pre-rendered
    *   Will non-AMP content be pre-rendered?
        *   If it has SGX
    *   SXG not a prerequisite for carousel eligibility
    *   When you say, 'we announced'  - does that mean google?
        *   Yes
    *   Signed exchanges have any direct or indirect bearing on results relevance?
        *   Not explicit criteria.
        *   Is SXG accounted for in perf measurements?
        *   Need to look at the standards
        *   All measured from navigation timestamp
            *   Standardized. When you click the link.
            *   This is actually measuring real-user performance. So prefetching will help.
            *   [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report)
    *   How fine-grained are Google-search perf indexing?
        *   Depends on how much traffic the site has. As fine-grained as possible.
        *   Will only rely on AMP content for mobile if it present.
        *   Google will also prioritize SXG when available.
    *   Re: 'top stories' changes move to any page, if comparable pages are on the site (amp and non amp), will the page lighter i.e. AMP be given preference over non amp page? 
    *   SXG docs pre-fetching is proxied through Google
    *   AMP pages are not pre-rendered, only pre-fetched with SXG - shouldn’t affect ‘content freshness’
    *   AIs:
        *   AC to gather further questions & create doc that would be suitable for constituencies to answer FAQs - work with Naina & Rudy on this as well
*   Performance Focus Area Discussion:
    *   [#32](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/32) - Provide Access to User Research
        *   Did not discuss
    *   [#80](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/80) - Trade-off Triangle
        *   Pablo presents issue to TSC attendees
            *   This is made even more of an issue with the ability of non-Web content to be in the carousel, now.
            *   Now that AMP has all of these components, “you can’t say no anymore.”
        *   Rudy:
            *   Core vitals are really centered on users.
            *   We need to really look at AMP vs. non-AMP perf in this context.
            *   2 year journey to open-up top carousel in order to allow publishers who know how to get there perf-wise not to have to use AMP for this.
            *   Drives a sharper focus on what AMP has to go do.
    *   [#84](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/84) - AMP Runtime
        *   Did not directly discuss
    *   [#87](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues/87) - AMP Perf Numbers Outside of Search
        *   Covered somewhat with the announcement discussion
