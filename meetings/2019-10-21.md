# **Minutes**

Should we keep recording the meetings?

We are going to continue recording and wait more opinions about to revisit it.

We don't have a solution to Kenji join the meetings due the timezone. We are going to wait the end of the year and rethink.

Pablo brings a good point: As AC is not anymore part of Google umbrella, how can we debate Google decisions about AMP, like the carrousel? 

We agree that AC doesn't have "control" about other organizations on how they use and build their own AMP solutions.

Project Board:

[https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/projects/1](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/projects/1)

Group discuss new tasks, like Transpiler HTML <-> AMPHtml. 

Signed exchanged (web packaging) was again a topic. What benefits AMP pre-render brings? Performance? Privacy?

A few notes was added to 'How can users opt-out of AMP'

Tobie suggests that each task should have a champion assigned.

We are going to have all the tasks into a spreadsheet, then we can prioritize them.
