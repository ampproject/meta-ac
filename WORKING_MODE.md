# Working mode of the AMP Advisory Committee (AC)


## Goal of the AC

Make AMP a great web citizen.

## Membership

The duration of a term is one year. The year starts on November 1st, regardless of when a member joined the AC.

There is no limit to the number of terms a member can do.

Two months before the end of the term year, members in "good standing"—those who have showed commitment to meeting [member expectations](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/blob/master/MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md) accounting for their personal and professional context—will be asked to rejoin. Members are under no obligation to do so.

### Election

The Current AC members approve any new AC member through the [consensus based process][consensus].

It is the AC's duty to ensure the AC is as representative and diverse as possible. When AC membership places are available, AC members commit to proactively reaching out to groups who are not currently represented.

### Resignation

Members may resign at any time by advising the facilitator in written of their desire to do so.

Resigning members may nominate a candidate to replace them, subject to the AC's consideration. Should the nominee be accepted by the AC, they will join the AC as an _interim member_ until the end of the current term or the next election cycle, whichever comes first. _Interim members_ who wish to continue to participate in the AC beyond this point and join it as a regular member will need to apply for a seat during the following election cycle.

## Representation

Members are representing themselves, not their employer. For more information about AC member expectations, please see [Member Expectations](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/blob/master/MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md).


## Conflict of interest

Members should disclose who their employer or clients are to avoid conflicts of interest, via a private mailing list if necessary.

Members should recuse themselves from decisions where proprietary interests might interfere with their judgment.


## Working mode

All proceedings are public.

AC advice to the [Technical Sterring Committee (TSC)][TSC] is non-binding.


## Facilitator

The AC has a [facilitator][]. Their role is to help organize discussions and drive them towards consensus.

The facilitator organizes meetings, publishes the meeting agenda, keeps a tab on the open issues, etc.

The facilitator generally acts as a liaison with the TSC.

The facilitator is responsible for making sure everyone feels welcomed and heard, and enforcing the code of conduct if necessary.


## Subcommittees

A subcommittee can be formed by a group of AC members who wish to focus on a particular topic for a fixed (generally short) period of time.

A subcommittee must have a [facilitator][], an area of focus, a set of deliverables, and an end date at which it presents its recommendations to the AC or requests to be renewed.

A subcommittee may include non-AC members. Its proceedings are public.

Subcommittees do not have any decision making authority. They only provide recommendations to the AC.


## Activities
 
Goals:

* Async communication.
* GitHub-based.
* Allows for varying degree of involvement.

In practice:

* Discuss GitHub issues filed on this repository (from fellow AC members, the TSC, [working groups (WG)][WG], [end-users][end-user], etc.).
* Review of [intent to implement issues (I2I)][I2I] either on the I2I itself or in a specific issue.
* Advice and discussions on topics brought up by the TSC.
* Publication of “opinions” on specific topics (audience: TSC, [collaborators][collaborator], but also platform implementers, devs, etc.).
* [Subcommittees](#Subcommittees) to work on specific projects (proceedings must also be public).
* Video conferences and calls as needed, potentially in sub-committees (to account for the size of the AC). Notes are public.
* Liaison with standards organizations and groups ([W3C][], [WHATWG][], [WICG][], [IETF][], etc.).
* Two single-day face to face meetings per year, aligned (if possible) with [AMP Conf][amp-conf] and AMP Contributor Summit.

## Decision making

Consensus-based as [described in the governance policy][consensus].
