[2020 Focus](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%222020+focus%22) strategy brainstorm

*   Timeboxed discussion of up to two 2020 Focus topics, ~20 minutes per topic
*   [Privacy Focus](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1B9MxnHysK8M_9R4xB-N0FxYM-TRvP4kRXt5SfyBYzlA/viewer) (Jamboard)
    *   Any feedback or input from CCPA?
    *   Yes, this is something we should dive into as a next priority
    *   What type of privacy issues are we worried about tackling?
        *   Opting out stuff for CA regulations - is there a to-do list?
        *   Ted: this is important, but we may not have the expertise 
            *   Should we bring in someone?
            *   Tobie was working on some of these issues from the NYT; someone from the TSC came in - we should follow up on this 
        *   Pablo: Consent in AMP, who manages? That was one of the bigger problems there - data privacy with different states
        *   Sumo: we should track the progress of what changes have been made - we should track offline
        *   Joe: Unclear where the TSC landed with this, where the community landed
        *   Melanie: it looks li
        *   Jory: Where do we want to fit?
        *   Melanie: How do we want to distribute the opinions of the AC? From a PRelations perspective, “X is what we think and advise” - this seems like an open issue for us to discuss - how do we share that knowledge?
        *   Joe: We never formalized that, to my recall.
        *   Melanie: We need to collaborate with the TSC - how would you like to receive feedback from AC
        *   Sumo: What about the feedback loop (closing the loop on issues that have gone to the TSC (issue RE CCPA)
    *   Sumo: can we get useful metrics to plug into the feedback cycle more? That should probably dictate what our priorities are
    *   Melanie: we should see about getting report numbers more frequently. I also see this is tied into the constituency issue
        *   Grok some of our administrative issues next week. Metrics, reporting, distribute/track the things we have decided. I think that would fit in the discussion window.
