# **Minutes:**

*   TSC & Design Review Meetings
    *   Let Jory know if you would like to attend Wednesday’s Design review meeting
    *   TSC review will be cancelled in favor of attending Design Meeting (conflict occurs every 6 weeks)
*   See Minutes from last meeting - approve PR once you’ve reviewed
*   Recording today’s presentations for sharing with the EMEA/APAC meeting. Not for historical archiving.
*   Presentation - Robin Berjon & Justin Heideman on the CAT proposal.
*   Discussion: 
    *   Is it possible for publishers to move off of valid and/or cached AMP if they want to?
      * Not possible if certain key Web properties still requires valid AMP pages
      * Not possible if perf requirements make it impossible for content that is neither prefetched nor prerendered to compete against content which is.
      * Critical to get clarity so publishers can plan accordingly and be ready by May deadline.
    *   Discussion of proposal to remove AMP Caches
      * For certain publishers, removing AMP caches is necessary for a broader diversity of content to exist and for fair competition in search engine placement.
      * For smaller content creators, AMP caches are a welcome addition that speed-up their content for free and they don't really have an issue with it.
    *   CAT next steps - more discussions and input from stakeholders. Forward path TBD in discussion with others including groups like the AC.
    *   Perhaps useful to break this into categories for requirements gathering?
    *   AC could be helpful by clarifying and documenting the distinction between the different components of AMP (open source project and the related products, e.g. the AMP caches), and clarify stakeholders/problem/opportunity areas within each.
*   Suggestion to dive into Core Web Vitals (CWV)? As these issues seem to overlap a lot.
    *   Plan is to establish a group of AC members to focus on CWV.
    *   Note that this also ties into 2021 roadmap to be discussed in next meeting (and already presented at the TSC).
    *   Getting clarity as to how CWV are going to work is critical to the Ac's constituencies.
    *   CWV are designed to reflect what happens in the real world and not a specific implementation detail.
    *   The understanding is that this includes the impact of AMP caches (prerendering, prefetching).
*   Proposal process for creating subcommittees.
    *   PR for an issue template to drive lightweight process for subcommittee discussions: [https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/pull/176](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/pull/176)
    *   Call for participants in the Core Web Vitals Subcommittee (open to non-AC members):
        [@DavidStrauss][DavidStrauss], [@darobin][darobin], [@candice-womp][candice-womp], [@kelseyjohnson8][kelseyjohnson8], [@marissa-halpert][marissa-halpert], [@baconjulie][baconjulie], [@MadisonMiner][MadisonMiner].
*   Aside - Infra WG to look into renaming main branch of `amphtml` repo. Other repos done already. Significant work to make sure all tooling and services are compatible with a renamed branch name for `amphtml` explains the delay in getting it updated. Julie to open an issue for us to track this.
