# Process Document

This document captures some of the administrative processes used to manage the AC in accordance with its [working mode](./WORKING_MODE.md).


## Stakeholder Input Process

Steps to take when an AC work item has been identified:

- [ ] New issue is raised by stakeholder
- [ ] Brought to the AC for discussion
- [ ] The AC identifies clear desired outcomes for the issue
- [ ] Issue is assigned to a champion (if no champion signs up, the issue is closed until a champion steps up)
- [ ] Champion brings issue to the TSC and/or the relevant Working Groups (WG), either by filing an issue or joining a meeting
- [ ] Champion drives the issue to resolution in collaboration with TSC/WG and stakeholder
