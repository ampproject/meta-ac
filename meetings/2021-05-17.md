# Minutes

*   Approve last call's minutes.
    *   Delayed as minutes weren’t ready
*   Check roster for TSC meeting.
*   Check roster for Design reviews.
    *   Proposal to deprecate about a third of AMP components [https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/34217](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/34217)
*   Long term vision TF update
*   AMP as a format. Guest presentation from [@davidgehring] and [@samparnell] of Distributed Media Labs (DML). DML relies on the AMP format to organize content syndication.
*   Topics discussed following the presentation:
    *   What problems does AMP help solve for DML? It provides a portable format.
    *   How is AMP different from RSS? RSS is about broadcasting but isn’t designed to transfer rich content. AMP fills that gap.
    *   What about Portals? It seems portals aren’t focused on solving the content portability aspects.
    *   Origin-less content is also an interesting use case for AMP which DML actually deploys (content that is only available for syndication).
    *   Content Aggregation Technology. David regrets that the open standard aspect of MP hasn’t been emphasized enough and that as a result AMP is perceived too much as a Google project which adversely affects it.
