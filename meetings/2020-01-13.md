# **Minutes**

*   Elect scribe
*   Slight changes to minute taking process (single doc)
*   Introduce [@jorydotcom](https://github.com/jorydotcom) (new role in AC)
    *   More clear and visible notes/minutes for public consumption
    *   Greater integration with OpenJS Foundation
*   Results of EOY new term confirmation
    *   Loss of members due to time constraints (Jervay Singh, Graham Loh, Léonie Watson)
*   Affiliation changes
    *   Joe joining Google Assistant team (congrats)
    *   Discussion on concerns about % of AC who are now Googlers, how this affects perspective diversity & optics
    *   Agree Joe can compartmentalize his roles, but it’s a question of optics. Further discussion/async decision on his continued membership pending.
*   Do we run an election? (discussion)
    *   Hold off for now unless we feel we are lacking perspective due to losses or lack of regional representation, in Asia for example
*   How do we move forward with [2020 focus](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%222020+focus%22)? (discussion)
    *   Suggestion for process:
        *   to get the AC input to be better fitted into the TSC priorities and ultimately drive regular input into the dev cycle process;
        *   measure success
        *   gather feedback from community
    *   Adding members interested in specific topics for async discussion pertaining to that focus
