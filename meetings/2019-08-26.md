# **Minutes**

People are reading profile's candidates to join the AC.

Dave Knecht decided to resign from the AC. He did so by emailing the facilitator as per the process. His resignation opens up a new seat on the AC. We’ll announce his resignation publicly at the same time as the results of the election.

What is the criteria to make the choices? Goal is to increase diversity as per our workmode (see [https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/blob/master/WORKING_MODE.md#election](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac/blob/master/WORKING_MODE.md#election)):

>_It is the AC's duty to ensure the AC is as representative and diverse as possible. When AC membership places are available, AC members commit to proactively reaching out to groups who are not currently represented._

Note that the election process is through consensus. We don't need to vote, just in case of disagreement.

We have 5 seats for the AC, but there isn't a fixed number for the new members we take onboard. 

The debate about the nomination isn’t minuted to preserve the privacy of the candidates.

The final decision will be async over email. Tentative by Thursday, so we have Friday and Monday to get in touch with the nominated candidates and to confirm that they are willing to join.
