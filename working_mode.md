# Working mode of the AMP Advisory Committee (AC)


## Goal of the AC

Make AMP a great web citizen.


## Representation

Members are representing themselves, not their employer.


## Conflict of interest

Members should disclose who their employer or clients are to avoid conflicts of interest, via a private mailing list if necessary.

Members should recuse themselves from decisions where proprietary interests might interfere with their judgment.


## Working mode

All proceedings are public.

AC advice to the [Technical Sterring Committee (TSC)][TSC] is non-binding.


## Facilitator

The AC has a [facilitator][]. Their role is to help organize discussions and drive them towards consensus.

The facilitator organizes meetings, publishes the meeting agenda, keeps a tab on the open issues, etc.

The facilitator generally acts as a liaison with the TSC.

The facilitator is responsible for making sure everyone feels welcomed and heard, and enforcing the code of conduct if necessary.


## Activities
 
Goals:

* Async communication.
* GitHub-based.
* Allows for varying degree of involvement.

In practice:

* Discuss GitHub issues filed on this repository (from fellow AC members, the TSC, [working groups (WG)][WG], [end-users][end-user], etc.).
* Review of [intent to implement issues (I2I)][I2I] either on the I2I itself or in a specific issue.
* Advice and discussions on topics brought up by the TSC.
* Publication of “opinions” on specific topics (audience: TSC, [collaborators][collaborator], but also platform implementers, devs, etc.).
* Sub-committees to work on specific projects (proceedings must also be public).
* Video conferences and calls as needed, potentially in sub-committees (to account for the size of the AC). Notes are public.
* Liaison with standards organizations and groups ([W3C][], [WHATWG][], [WICG][], [IETF][], etc.).
* Two single-day face to face meetings per year, aligned (if possible) with [AMP Conf][amp-conf] and AMP Contributor Summit.

## Decision making

Consensus-based as [described in the governance policy][consensus].
